# 1. Problem 
Large Language Model - GPT-3 175B
# 2. Directions

Our codebase is capable of training large language models with both model and data parallelism
.
To use this repository, please install a supported version of PyTorch with GPU support (python 3.8, pytorch 1.8, cuda 11.1, and nccl 2.8.3 and above) and NVIDIA [APEX](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex#quick-start). We recommend using one of [NGC's PyTorch containers](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:pytorch). The latest tested compatible version is `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.04-py3`).

To train GPT-3, set `COM_DIR` in `gpt3_blend.sh` to point to the C4 dataset location which contains the dataset after preprocessing.

```
sbatch run_gpt3.sh <path to log directory> <path to BPE processed directory>
```

Use script `run_gpt3.sh` as shown above to run GPT-3 175B on clusters using slurm. You can adjust number of nodes (tested only with nodes>=8) and job run time in the sbatch command in line #3 of the `run_gpt3.sh` script.

Some things to note regarding the above script -
1. The model trains for 15 mins lesser than that actual run time because the last 15 mins are set aside for storing a checkpoint of the last iteration.

Command line arguments are described in detail in this source file [`arguments.py`](./megatron/arguments.py).


# 3. Dataset/Environment
We use C4/en/3.0.1 dataset from [HuggingFace/AllenAI](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/c4).
We do not host any datasets for GPT training.
For validation, a subset of the validation dataset has been selected. Details as follows:
24,567 examples were [selected](https://github.com/sgpyc/training/blob/paxml-llm-draft/large_language_model/paxml/utils/select_example.md) in the validation split to form a smaller eval set. The resulting tfrecord file is at gs://mlperf-llm-public2/c4/en/3.0.1/c4-validation_24567exp.tfrecord , with hashes of the text at gs://mlperf-llm-public2/c4/en/3.0.1/c4-validation_24567exp.hash.

### Data Preprocessing using SPM
Run the following commands to merge 1024 original `json.gz` files into 8 `json.gz` files. Each of the 8 `json.gz` file will be preprocessed into a pair of megatron dataset files (`.bin` and `.idx`).

```bash
cd <path to C4>

# create softlinks to store each shard before merging
mkdir -p softlinks
for shard in {0..7}; do
  start=$((shard * 128))
  end=$((shard * 128 + 127))
  mkdir -p softlinks/en_$shard
  for ind in $(seq -f "%05g" $start $end); do
    ln -s ../../en/c4-train.${ind}-of-01024.json.gz softlinks/en_${shard}/c4-train.${ind}-of-01024.json.gz
  done
done

# merge
mkdir -p en_merge
for shard in {0..7}; do 
  cat softlinks/en_${shard}/*gz > en_merge/c4-train.en_${shard}.json.gz 
done
cat en/c4-validation.0000* > en_merge/c4-validation.json.gz
```

After preparing the data folder, download tokenizer model.
Currently, SPM trained by google using [these](https://github.com/sgpyc/training/blob/paxml-llm-draft/large_language_model/paxml/utils/generate_spm.md) instructions is used.

Modify `C4_PATH` in `preprocess.sh` and `preprocess_val.sh` to specify
the correct input/output paths and run preprocessing as follows
```bash
sbatch preprocess.sh <path to c4>
sbatch preprocess_val.sh <path to c4>
```

Currently, the training script expects BPE [vocab.json](https://huggingface.co/gpt2/resolve/main/vocab.json) and [merges.txt](https://huggingface.co/gpt2/resolve/main/merges.txt) files. These files are used to create a BPE tokenizer which is only used for two things at this point in the code since tokenization is already done in the above step:

1. To find out the eod entry index (value is 5025)
2. To find out the vocab size (value is 50257)

# 3. Run External Checkpoints
To run external checkpoints (including modified PAXML checkpoint), add following arguments to the run script after converting these checkpoints to the Megatron compliant format:
```bash
--no-load-rng \
--use-ext-ckpt \
--load {EXTERNAL_MODEL_CHECKPOINT_DIR} \
--ext-iterations {TRAINING_ITERATIONS} \
--ext-optim-dir {EXTERNAL_OPTIMIZER_CHECKPOINT_DIR} \
--ext-lr-steps {GLOBAL_BATCH_SIZE * TRAINING_ITERATIONS} \
```
